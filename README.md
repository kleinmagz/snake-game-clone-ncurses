# snake-game-clone-ncurses
A snake game clone made in C using ncurses library. Used to 
apply data structures to programming.

# Compatibility
Since this game is made using ncurses, it runs natively in Linux.
This program unfortunately can't run in windows systems - requires
one to install WSL(Windows Subsystems for Linux).
